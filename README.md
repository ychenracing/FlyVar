##flyvar##

FlyVar is a free integrative platform that addresses the increasing need of next generation sequencing data analysis in the Drosophila research community. It is composed of three parts.

1. a database that contains 5.94 million DNA polymorphisms found in Drosophila melanogaster derived from whole genome shotgun sequencing of 561 genomes of D. melanogaster. It shows an average of one variant per 20 bases across the genome.
2. a GUI interface has been implemented to allow easy and flexible query of the database.
3. a set of interactive online tools enables filtering and annotation of genomic sequence obtained from individual D. melanogaster strains to identify candidate mutations.

FlyVar permits the analysis of next generation sequencing data without the need of extensive computational training or resources.
